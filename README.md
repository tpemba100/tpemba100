- 👋 Hi, I’m Tsering Pemba.
- 👀 I’m interested in being a developer with background in visual and user experience design.
- 🌱 I’m comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS, React.JS and Node. I attended a bootcamp for frontend and gained knowledge to build my own applications from design to development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that may require a hybrid role that act as a bridge between UX designer and fullstack Developer.
