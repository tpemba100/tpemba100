- 👋 Hi, I’m Tsering Pemba.
- 👀 I’m interested in being a developer with background in visual and user experience design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to master React.JS and backend development by learning everyday and building real full projects from design to development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that may require a hybrid role that act as a bridge between UX designer and fullstack Developer.
